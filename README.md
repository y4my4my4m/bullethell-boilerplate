# Bullet Hell - Game Boilerplate
A boilerplate for a bullethell game in Python

## About
Just a simple bullethell boilerplate.
It's not intended to be a well organized or a template.
It's all in one script by design.
Things could be organized better as well, but it should serve as a good basic example regardless.
